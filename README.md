# Book Publishing Trends & Forecast (1990–2020)

## Purpose
To analyze four decades of book publishing data (1990–2020), identify key market drivers via Pareto analysis, and forecast future publication and reader-rating trends—providing actionable insights for publishers and authors to optimize output and engagement.

## Tools & Packages
- **Data cleaning:** `janitor`, `lubridate`  
- **Visualization:** `ggplot2`  
- **Analysis:** Pareto charts, trend extrapolation

## Project Overview
Cleaned and standardized a 52,448-record, multi-decade books dataset—filtered outliers to establish a reliable baseline for analysis.

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Histograms** of page counts (most books: 250–410 pages)  
- **Boxplots** & **line charts** of star ratings (clustered at 3.5–4.5)  
- **Publication volume** trendline (steady with slight growth in the late 2000s)

---

## Pareto Analysis
- Identified the **top 20%** of publishers responsible for **~80%** of total titles  
- Highlighted key publishers for strategic partnerships

---

## Forecasting Future Trends
- **Extrapolated** historical publication & rating trajectories  
- **Predicted** marginal increases in total titles  
- **Projected** continued stability in reader satisfaction  

> **Actionable Insight:**  
> Publishers can anticipate slight growth in output and should focus on maintaining high ratings around 3.5–4.5 stars to sustain reader engagement.
